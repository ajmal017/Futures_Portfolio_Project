# Futures_Portfolio_Project
Project Goals:
1. Collect end-of-day (EOD) historical data from Quandl on the most liquid futures markets that trade on exchanges around the world.
2. Also collect EOD foreign exchange (FX), interest rate, and weekly Commitment Of Traders (COT) data that will be used later for analysis.
3. Organize data into 5 tables and write to a SQLite database.
